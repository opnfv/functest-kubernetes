      "message": "Sorry I don\u0027t want to add container4nfv here, the following are the reasons.\n(If you still think container4nfv needs run k8s_conformance, I could add :).)\n\nI do not think it is necessary to run k8s_conformance for container4nfv:\n    - run k8s_conformance takes too lang time(about 1 hour)\n    - container4nfv just use kubeadm to install k8s(kubeadm is k8s community official k8s installing tool), it should pass k8s_conformance. Here is the kube-master setup script:\n    https://git.opnfv.org/container4nfv/tree/src/vagrant/kubeadm_istio/master_setup.sh\n    - k8s_smoke for simply verifing k8s works well, clover_k8s covers clover specific testcases is enough for now.\n\nI\u0027ve run k8s_conformance on my local env it took about one hour and passed. And I also checked one on-line [compass4nfv\u0027 functest log](https://build.opnfv.org/ci/job/functest-compass-virtual-daily-master/127/console). It also took about one hour to run. \n\n|     k8s_conformance     |     functest     |      57:54       |      PASS      |",
